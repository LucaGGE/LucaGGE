## Purpose and Key Principles

[![Open Source Love svg2](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v2/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

My purpose is to **Research, Design, and Develop Open Source Software (OSS)**, with a particular focus on creating accessible games and tools. My Key Principles are rooted in the propositions of _enjoyment, sharing,_ and _hands-on learning_. 

### Key Principles

- **Open Source Philosophy**: I create software that is meant to be shared and improved upon, allowing others to benefit from the work and creativity that goes into each project.

- **Modding-Friendly**: All my software is designed with modding (or customization) in mind. I believe that the contributions of the community and the personalization of the experience not only allow a deeper involvement with the projects, but that they represent the best for the growth and improvement of the latter.

- **Commitment to Excellence and Ethics**: I hold myself to high standards in both the quality of my software and the ethical implications of my designs. My work reflects a sincere dedication to making positive contributions to the community.

- **Non-Profit Motive**: I develop software with a commitment to openness and accessibility, prioritizing community value over profit. My primary focus is on process and quality, and I endeavor to share everything I create in an open and free manner. While I reserve the right to offer completely optional supplementary products for sale, these will be carefully priced to ensure they remain accessible to everyone.\
_To better clarify this point, that I hold dearly,_ imagine a community garden where everyone is invited to come and grow their own vegetables. In this garden, I provide all the essential tools - fertilizers, seeds, and gardening equipment - completely free of charge. Anyone can use these resources to cultivate their own crops and enjoy the fruits of their labor.\
Now, if someone wants to enhance their gardening experience, I offer optional tools like specialty planters, organic pest repellents or unique seed varieties for sale. These extras are designed to improve the gardening process but are not necessary to grow a healthy garden. You can also buy them somewhere else if you feel like it, or you can even build them yourself.

- **Licensing**: I best like weak copyleft licenses, but I have to adopt what best suits the specific project. Hard copyleft licenses, for example, are a must for any software with industrial or commercial applications, as experience has amply demonstrated the incorrectness and lack of scruples of those who pursue exclusively a profit motive.

**Why should I ever donate money to OSS? It's free!**\
_My argument on why we should donate_

Imagine a world where the tools we use every day are built not by ruthless giant corporations solely focused on squeezing profit out of us, but by passionate people actually driven by love for what they do and a desire to share and collaborate with others.\
That's the power of open-source software.\
When we donate to projects we care about, we're not simply showing appreciation; we're giving someone (sometimes several people) the freedom to spend more time making something better, for everyone. And when a lot of people decide to donate, it comes to a point when we can have _full time_ teams working on impressive projects, making them more and more amazing! I think we can take _Blender_ as a prime example of that.

Open-source creators listen to their users, fix problems quickly, and build features that people actually want. They're not trying to trap you into an ecosystem of their convenience or to coerce (_coerce!_) you to give them every last drop of data.\
They believe in sharing and collaboration.

By supporting creators, we're giving corporate giants who _always_ prioritize profit over people a kick in the butt.\
We're helping to build a more transparent network, where innovation comes from everywhere, and where technology is used to _empower_ us, not _control_ and _exploit_ us.\
So, next time we use a piece of open-source software, we should stop for a moment and consider chipping in a few bucks. I truly believe it's an investment for a brighter, richer, more just future.
