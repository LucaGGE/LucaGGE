## Mission and Goals
Developing OS games and tools for everybody to enjoy, share, learn from and modify.
I use MPL2.0, so the public property can be **protected** and you're **free** to use whatever you learn or inspires you.

All my games are created with **no end purpose of selling or making a profit**.
All my games are designed and developed with **OS and modding in mind**.
All my games have **Excellence and Ethics** as intrinsic commitment.
